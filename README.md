## Code Review

**Issues :** 
- Didn't know how to darken Hero section background image so I google searched to solve problem. Problem was solved by writing the following code:
    -  .hero-section {
    background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(87, 87, 87, 0.5), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)), url(/assets/image/restaurant-image.jpeg);

- Had issue with too many lines of code, so i've seperated font.css, style.css, and button.css in different files to have them more organized.
    
- I wanted to create a hamburger navigation, however my html code was too messy to fix into creating a hamburger nav.
